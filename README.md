The Application has been developed start from scratch  with npx create-react-app

Steps to Install the Node modules and run the Application

step1:cafe-employee\server>  Install Node Modules with npm Install command
step2: Run the server with the command npm start so that the server will start and run on the browser with Port number 3000 
   for cafePage and Employee details which will be running in the backend 
step3: \cafe-employee> Install Node Modules with npm Install command
step4: once all the Installation is done then run the frontend application with command npm start and run on the browser with Port number 3001 

All the CRUD operations is done for both the pages as per the requirement shared in the documents with Add New Record, Edit Record, Update Record and Delete Record Using AG-Grid requirement. 
  For Front End I have Used: ReactJS, React-router for views, Redux for the Store management, Material-Ui as CSS Framework and for Tables I have used AG-Grid. 
 other supporting features also has been Implemented like  Pagination, filter, sorting.
Along with this, the required screenshot has been taken and Uploaded in the Repo itself.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
